Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering
Overview
This project is part of my Introduction to Machine Learning course, where I applied K-means clustering to segment customers based on their shopping behavior. The dataset used is the Mall Customer Segmentation Data from Kaggle, which includes information on customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

Objectives
Apply K-means clustering to segment customer data.
Analyze patterns and characteristics of each customer segment without predefined labels.
Visualize the clusters and provide insights into customer behavior.
Dataset
Source: Mall Customer Segmentation Data from Kaggle
Features:
CustomerID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)
Project Steps
1. Data Exploration
Load the dataset
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Display first few rows
Summary statistics of numerical features
Check for missing values
2. Clustering Implementation
Select relevant features for clustering
Features: Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)
Standardize the features
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
Implement K-means clustering with the optimal number of clusters
Optimal number of clusters determined: 4
3. Analysis of Clusters
Analyze and profile the characteristics of each customer cluster
Visualize the clusters using scatter plots
Age vs. Annual Income
Age vs. Spending Score
Annual Income vs. Spending Score
Results
Cluster Profiling:
Mean values of numerical features for each cluster.
Insights into customer behavior in each cluster.
Visualizations:
Scatter plots to visualize the distribution and separation of clusters.
